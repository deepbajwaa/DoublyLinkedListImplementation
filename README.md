# DoublyLinkedListImplementation
I wanted to practice implementing a double linked list, and wanted to learn about how they work to make me a better programmer.

To Run:
1. Clone the repository and copy paste the doublyList.h and doublyList.c files into your project.
2. You can now either use your own makefile, or the makefile to compile together the .c file with your main.
3. Run accordingly to how you have your makefile structure setup.

List of Functions(with descriptions):

1. printList - This will print the list in order.

  -@param head this is a pointer to the start of the list.
2. printListReverse - This will print the list backwards.

  -@param head this is a pointer to the start of the list.
3. freeList - This will free the memory allocated by the list.

  -@param head this is a pointer to the start of the list.
4. append - This will add a node to the end of the list.

  -@param head the memory address of the head of the list should be passed to this function.
  
   -@param data this is any number you want to add to the list.
5. prepend - This will add a node to the beggining of the list.

  -@param head the memory address of the head of the list should be passed to this function.
   -@param data this is any number you want to add to the list.
6. removeNode - This

  -@param head the memory address of the head of the list should be passed to this function.
  
   -@param data this is the node you want to remove from the list.
